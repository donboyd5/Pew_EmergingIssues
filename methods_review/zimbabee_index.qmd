# Morning session

# <span style="font-size:.85em;">*Institutional players in the budget process*

## The executive proposes, the legislature disposes (?)

-   Generally true, but major exceptions[^1]

    -   Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas all write budgets

    -   Texas

-   Different legislative roles in different arrangements

-   New York - strong executive budget

    -   Stronger over time
