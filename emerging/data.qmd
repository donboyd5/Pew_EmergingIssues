> The National Risk Index is a dataset and online tool to help illustrate the U.S. communities most at risk for 18 natural hazards: Avalanche, **Coastal Flooding**, Cold Wave, Drought, **Earthquake**, Hail, **Heat Wave**, **Hurricane**, Ice Storm, Landslide, Lightning, Riverine Flooding, Strong Wind, Tornado, Tsunami, Volcanic Activity, **Wildfire**, and Winter Weather. The National Risk Index provides relative Risk Index scores and ratings based on data for Expected Annual Loss due to natural hazards, Social Vulnerability, and Community Resilience. Separate scores and ratings are also provided for Expected Annual Loss, Social Vulnerability, and Community Resilience. For the Risk Index and Expected Annual Loss, scores and ratings can be viewed as a composite score for all hazards or individually for each of the 18 hazard types.

The National Risk Index provides relative Risk Index scores and ratings based on data for [Expected Annual Loss](https://hazards.fema.gov/nri/expected-annual-loss) due to natural hazards, [Social Vulnerability](https://hazards.fema.gov/nri/social-vulnerability), and [Community Resilience](https://hazards.fema.gov/nri/community-resilience). Separate scores and ratings are also provided for each component: Expected Annual Loss, Social Vulnerability, and Community Resilience. For the Risk Index and Expected Annual Loss, scores and ratings can be viewed as a composite score for all hazards or individually for each of the 18 hazard types. You can explore all scores and ratings using the interactive National Risk Index map.

### Expected annual loss

4.3. Expected Annual Loss (EAL)

(From technical documentation)

The EAL for each Census tract or county is the average economic loss in dollars resulting from natural hazards each year. EAL is computed for each hazard type and only quantifies loss for relevant consequence types (i.e., buildings, population, or agriculture). For example, many hazard types only significantly impact buildings and population, so the loss to agriculture is not included in the computation. However, the EAL for Drought only quantifies the damage to agriculture (crops and livestock) in its computation. Agriculture is considered a relevant consequence type for hazard types where it has historically contributed greater than 1% of the total reported losses.

All loss is quantified as a dollar amount. While building and agriculture losses are quantified in dollars in the source data, **population loss is quantified as the number of fatalities and injuries and must be converted to ensure all EAL values use a common unit of measurement. Population loss is monetized into a population equivalence value using a Value of Statistical Life (VSL) approach in which each fatality or ten injuries is treated as \$7.6 million of economic loss, an inflation-adjusted VSL used by FEMA.**7 To **adjust for inflation**, all historic losses are converted to 2020 dollars.

## NCEI

The National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI), an agency within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), tracks the cost of environmental disasters, including hurricanes and other tropical cyclones, severe storms, drought, floods, wildfires, crop freezes, and other natural disaster risks.[^data-1]

[^data-1]: Both are in the U.S. Department of Commerce.

NCEI takes into account estimates of insured and uninsured losses from damage to physical assets such as buildings and their contents, infrastructure, and vehicles; crop, livestock, and timber losses; disaster restoration and wildfire suppression costs; and business interruption losses. The estimates do not include losses related to natural assets, health care, or values associated with loss of life.

Hurricanes vs. tornadoes: according to [NOAA (March 2021)](https://www.spc.noaa.gov/faq/tornado/#Damage):

> How does the damage from tornadoes compare to that of hurricanes? The differences are in scale. Even though winds from the strongest tornadoes far exceed that from the strongest hurricanes, hurricanes typically cause much more damage individually and over a season, and over far bigger areas. Economically, tornadoes cause about a tenth as much damage per year, on average, as hurricanes. Hurricanes tend to cause much more overall destruction than tornadoes because of their much larger size, longer duration and their greater variety of ways to affect property. The destructive core in hurricanes can be tens of miles across, last many hours and damage structures through storm surge and rainfall-caused flooding, as well as from wind. Tornadoes, in contrast, tend to be a few hundred yards in diameter, last for minutes and primarily cause damage from their extreme winds.

## EM-DAT

<https://www.emdat.be/welcome>

> In 1988, the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED) launched the Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT). EM-DAT was created with the initial support of the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Belgian Government.
>
> The main objective of the database is to serve the purposes of humanitarian action at national and international levels. The initiative aims to rationalise decision making for disaster preparedness, as well as provide an objective base for vulnerability assessment and priority setting.
>
> EM-DAT contains essential core data on the occurrence and effects of over 22,000 mass disasters in the world from 1900 to the present day. The database is compiled from various sources, including UN agencies, non-governmental organisations, insurance companies, research institutes and press agencies.

EM-DAT - number of events in U.S. 2000-2022, average deaths and economic damage per event, and total deaths and economic damage, in \$k; sorted by mean damage. Notice \# storms, mean deaths drought and extreme temperature.
