## Boyd Questions

-   To what extent do you want this to be focused on *emerging* issues?

    -   For example, economic shocks aren't new. There are always new shocks, and often they are different in character from earlier shocks. Did you want the economic shocks section focused on "new" economic shocks, related to new risks (I am not sure what they would be) or on shocks more generally

    -   Similarly, disasters are not new, although we may have more-frequent and more-severe disasters due to climate change. Do you want the disaster section focused on new risks, or all risks?

-   I've noted potential sub-issues in each major category based on Page's review of existing research, and other information. It would be nice to know your priorities for sub-issues - or alternatively, we could discuss process for fleshing those priorities out.
