# Economic Shocks

## Discussion of the risk

### Questions

What are the key risk elements?

What *mechanism* makes it a risk to government finances?

How large is the risk? How certain? To what extent might it grow or shrink?

How does the risk vary - e.g., across geography, race, age, kind of government? How susceptible are different states and groups?

### Elements

-   Recessions

-   Housing crises

-   Public health crises

-   Other

## Potential management and mitigation solutions

-   What kinds of policy responses are available?

-   What kinds of preparation and mitigation policies are available?

-   What do we know from research about the effectiveness of these policies?

-   What roles should different levels of government play in responses and preparation?

-   Examples of policies currently being used by state and federal governments

-   Options for governments to consider
