# Climate Change and Natural Disasters

## Discussion of the risk

### Questions

What are the key risk elements?

What *mechanism* makes it a risk to government finances?

How large is the risk? How certain? To what extent might it grow or shrink?

How does the risk vary - e.g., across geography, race, age, kind of government? How susceptible are different states and groups?

### Key Risk Elements

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) defines natural hazards as "... environmental phenomena that have the potential to impact societies and the human environment. These should not be confused with other types of hazards, such as manmade hazards. For example, a flood resulting from changes in river flows is a natural hazard, whereas flooding due to a dam failure is considered a manmade hazard." (@zuzakNationalRiskIndex2021)

FEMA has constructed a National Risk Index (NRI) database with estimates of the risks that states, counties, and Census tracts face for 18 different natural hazards. The database includes a hazard if at least half of the FEMA-required state hazard mitigation plans include the hazard, or if it is regionally significant, defined as "having the capacity to cause widespread, catastrophic damage, such as Hurricane, Tsunami, and Volcanic Activity" even if not included in a majority of state plans. (@zuzakNationalRiskIndex2021)

The figure below shows in the table at top the 18 natural hazards included in the NRI database, and in the bar chart at bottom the number of states that include any of 29 natural or human-made hazards in their FEMA mitigation plan. (FEMA collapses the full set of included hazards into the 18 categories.)

![Hazards included in state hazard mitigation plans.](images/image-31705419.png)

For each hazard in the NRI database, FEMA has estimated for each state, county, and Census tract the exposure to risk and the expected annual loss (insured and uninsured) from the hazard. For most risks it also includes estimates of the expected frequency of hazard events. The estimates are based on historical data and extensive modeling, and the methodology has been subject to extensive review. FEMA notes, however, that while the database is useful for planning and for broad national comparisons, some users may have access to more accurate local data. (@zuzakNationalRiskIndex2021)

One advantage of these data is that unlike several other hazard databases, the NRI database includes estimates of the "statistical" value of injury and loss of life. However, the NRI data do not appear to include estimates of business interruption losses, whereas some other data sources appear to. For a discussion of alternative data sources, see the appendix.

### Magnitude, likelihood, and variation in the risks

#### Earthquakes

![](images/image-554267415.png)

According to the Congressional Research Service:

> Alaska is the most earthquake-prone state; it has experienced a magnitude 7.0 earthquake almost every year and a magnitude 8.0 earthquake every 13 years, on average, since 1900. Alaskan earthquakes can trigger damaging tsunamis, which can be particularly threatening for Alaska, Washington, Oregon, California, and Hawaii. California has the greatest earthquake risk, because the state has frequent earthquakes that affect a dense built environment and a large population.[^1]

## Economic impacts of disasters

The estimates in the NRI database do not include secondary effects of natural disasters through their impacts on the economy. \[give estimate of approximate size of these effects, drawn from economic literature\]

## Trends and outlook for natural disasters

-   Document the increasing frequency and intensity of certain kinds of disasters. Possible sources include @balaguruIncreasingHurricaneIntensification2022 and @benderModeledImpactAnthropogenic2010

## Will historically-based estimates of expected loss be reasonable predictors of future losses?

## Other items to address

-   How should we think about disaster risk? (expected direct loss, economic loss, single-large event, deaths, ability to withstand disaster)

-   Social vulnerability, community resilience

-   rationales for federal, state, local roles

-   flooding/hurricane/storm linkage (a data interpretation question) - I may need to talk to FEMA about this.

## Potential management and mitigation solutions

-   What kinds of policy responses are available?

-   What kinds of preparation and mitigation policies are available?

-   What do we know from research about the effectiveness of these policies?

-   What roles should different levels of government play in responses and preparation?

-   Examples of policies currently being used by state and federal governments

-   Options for governments to consider

### The role of federal, state, and local governments

Federal agencies can provide guidance and support for the development of state and local plans, including technical assistance and advice on strategies, while state and local governments can tailor their plans to the unique risks and resources of their communities. Collaboration between levels of government can help ensure that plans are comprehensive, coordinated, and effective.

During a disaster response, federal agencies can provide additional resources and support to state and local governments, particularly when disasters are large-scale or require specialized expertise or equipment. However, state and local governments should be the primary responders to disasters, as they are typically closest to the affected communities and have a better understanding of local needs and resources.

Federal, state, and local governments can all play important roles in reducing the risks associated with natural hazards. Federal agencies can provide funding, technical assistance, and guidance for mitigation efforts, while state and local governments can identify and implement mitigation strategies that are tailored to their communities.

## The role of FEMA

Under federal regulations, hazard mitigation is "any sustained action taken to reduce or eliminate the long-term risk to human life and property from hazards."[^2]

[^2]: [44 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) § 201.2 Definitions.](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-44/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-201)

FEMA requires states to prepare State Mitigation Plans. There are two kinds of State Mitigation Plans - a standard plan and an enhanced plan. An enhanced plan typically includes a more extensive risk assessment, more detailed analysis of mitigation strategies, and a more robust evaluation process. In addition, enhanced plans may create opportunities for additional federal funding under the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP).

Among other things, FEMA requires a State Mitigation Plan to include:

1.  **Risk Assessment:** A comprehensive analysis of the natural hazards and risks facing the state, including earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, wildfires, and other hazards.

2.  **Capability Assessment:** An evaluation of the state's ability to respond to and recover from these hazards, including the identification of critical infrastructure and the resources necessary to mitigate and respond to disasters.

3.  **Mitigation Strategy:** A plan for reducing the risks associated with natural hazards, including the development of hazard mitigation projects, policies, and regulations.

4.  **Plan Maintenance:** A plan for maintaining and updating the state's mitigation plan over time, including a schedule for revising the plan and a process for monitoring progress.

5.  **Public Involvement:** A plan for engaging with stakeholders and the public in the development and implementation of the mitigation plan, including the identification of key partners and the dissemination of information about the plan.

6.  **Plan Implementation:** A plan for implementing the mitigation strategy, including the allocation of resources, the development of project proposals, and the establishment of partnerships with other organizations and agencies.

7.  **Plan Evaluation:** A process for evaluating the effectiveness of the mitigation plan, including the identification of performance metrics and the development of a plan for monitoring and evaluating progress over time.

See (@federalemergencymanagementagencyStateMitigationPlanning2022)

\[Questions - how do states vary in depth and quality of these plans? do they have other plans that are the "real" plans or are these real, working documents? are they faithful in following these plans? How do states differ in key policy choices, such as responsibilities of the state vs. its localities?\]

### Florida (hurricanes)

#### The State Mitigation Plan

Florida has an Enhanced State Mitigation Plan, which allows it to gain an additional 5 percentage points of recovery funds under FEMA's Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP).

##### Mitigation

###### Hurricane Loss Mitigation Program (HLMP)

The Hurricane Loss Mitigation Program (HLMP) is a state administered grant and receives \$10 million annually from the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Trust Fund (Ch. §215.559, Florida Statutes).

Three million dollars is allocated towards the purpose of retrofitting existing facilities that are used as public hurricane shelters. Each year the Division shall prioritize the use of these funds for projects included in the annual report of the Shelter Retrofit Report prepared in accordance with § 252.385(3). The Division is required to give funding priority to projects in regional planning council regions that have shelter deficits and to projects that maximize the use of state funds.

Up to \$3.5 million is to be used to improve the wind resistance of residences through loans, subsidies, grants, demonstration projects, direct assistance, and cooperative programs with local and federal governments. The program is developed in coordination with the Advisory Council whose members consist of representatives from the Florida Association of Counties, the Florida Department of Insurance, the Federation of Manufactured Home Owners, the Florida Manufactured Housing Association, the Florida Insurance Council, and the Florida Home Builders Association.

\$2.8 million is designated for the Mobile Home Tie-Down Program. Based on legislative directive the Florida Division of Emergency Management provides funding for mobile home tie-downs across the state, a program administered by Tallahassee Community College (TCC). By statute, TCC prepares a separate report for the Governor and the Legislature on these directives.

\$700,000 is designated for Hurricane Research to be conducted by Florida International University (FIU) to continue the development of an innovative research of a full-scale structural testing to determine inherent weakness of structures when subjected to categories 1 to 5 hurricane-force winds and rain, leading to new technologies, designs and products.

Through partnering with local housing authorities and non-profit organizations, the Division has been able to promote wind mitigation and provide hazard mitigation upgrades to residents. Funded activities include retrofits, inspections, and construction or modification of building components designed to increase a structure's ability to withstand hurricane-force winds. The Retrofit Program utilizes the Florida Building Code as its standard for all retrofitting.

Grant funds awarded under the HLMP qualify as state financial assistance under the Florida Single Audit Act. See Section 215.971, Florida Statutes. The Catalog of State Financial Assistance number (CSFA#) for HLMP is 31.066. Because the Legislature provides the Division with HLMP funds through the grants and aid appropriation category, eligible proposers under this request for proposal (RPF) include governmental entities, nonprofit organizations, and qualified for-profit organizations; individual homeowners are ineligible to apply.

#### Miscellaneous notes

[@bloetscherAdaptationFloridaUrban2017]

@bloetscherAdaptationFloridaUrban2017 says such and such

-   In 2017 Gov. Charlie Crist created the Florida Governor's Action Team on Energy and Climate Change by [executive order](https://www.fsec.ucf.edu/en/media/enews/2007/pdf/07-128-actionteam.pdf). Gov. Rick Scott appears not to have continued (check)

Excerpt from the latest state OS (\$132,720,000 State of Florida Full Faith and Credit Department of Transportation Right-of-Way Acquisition and Bridge Construction Refunding Bonds Series 2022A) (EMMA, MSRB-P2414503.zip)

Environmental Risk Factors section:

> With more than 2,000 linear miles of coastline and relatively low elevations, Florida's weather and natural resources affect its economy in a variety of ways. Economic activity attributable to in-migration and tourism represents a significant part of the State's economy, and the State's warm weather and beaches are responsible for attracting seasonal and permanent residents and tourists to the State. In addition, a majority of the State's residents live and work in coastal counties. Because of the State's reliance on its natural resources to generate business and sustain in-migration, its economy and financial condition may be vulnerable to the impacts of environmental events, including hurricanes and inland and coastal flooding, as well as long-term environmental risks associated with climate change, such as accelerated sea level rise. 
>
> The State has effectively responded to past environmental events because of its financial resources, emergency response system, and dedicated leadership and regulatory programs focused on addressing environmental risks. However, the frequency of environmental events, such as hurricanes, may increase on an annual basis according to models and forecasts. Consequently, the magnitude of the impact on the State's operations, economy, or financial condition from environmental risks is indeterminate and is unpredictable for future environmental events. There can be no assurance that such risks will not have an adverse effect the operations, economy, or financial condition of the State.
>
> *Resources* - The State has a variety of resources available to respond to damage caused by environmental events. The State has financial reserves available to cover response-related expenditures, and, in most cases, the State can request reimbursement from federal relief funds to pay for a portion of such expenditures. Further, upon a declaration of a state of emergency, Florida law provides the Governor broad spending authority to meet financial needs resulting from a disaster. Notwithstanding multiple hurricanes, State finances and the economy have only experienced temporary economic disruption. In addition, the State has improved its resiliency to the threat of environmental risks through the establishment of the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund and the Citizens Property Insurance Corporation to stabilize the property insurance market in the State.
>
> *Emergency Response* - The State can respond to the impacts of environmental events through its robust emergency response system. The Division of Emergency Management ("DEM") was established as part of the State's structure to plan for and respond to both natural and manmade disasters. In addition to coordinating disaster response activities, DEM prepares and implements a statewide Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan and routinely conducts extensive exercises to test state and county emergency response capabilities.
>
> *Leadership* - The State's response to environmental risks includes the creation of state-level leadership positions to help coordinate resilience efforts through Florida's 67 counties and over 400 cities. Although a portion of environmental resiliency efforts in each county or city falls on its respective local government leadership, state-level leadership provides valuable resources and support to the State's local governments. In 2019, the Governor created the position of Chief Resilience Officer in the Executive Office of the Governor to work with state agencies to, in part, develop and coordinate the implementation of a comprehensive statewide resilience plan with goals designed to adapt to the environmental challenges facing Florida's communities. Also in 2019, the Governor created the Office of Environmental Accountability and Transparency, led by the State's Chief Science Officer, to conduct scientific research that focuses on current and emerging environmental concerns most pressing to Floridians. The Chief Resilience Officer consults with the Chief Science Officer on policy issues so that each policy decision takes into consideration the environmental impact strictly from a scientific perspective.
>
> *Regulatory Programs and Planning* -- State Level - The State's resilience to environmental risks has been enhanced through state law restrictions and targeted regulatory programs. Coastal construction is regulated by DEP in various ways in order to protect Florida's beaches and dunes from imprudent construction. For example, under the Coastal Zone Protection Act, Florida law imposes strict construction standards for most activities within the "coastal building zone", which covers over 1,500 feet from the coastline. Further, the Office of Resilience and Coastal Protection was created within DEP to focus time, energy, and resources into resiliency issues. DEP regulations include a prohibition on most construction within 50 feet of the mean high-water line, known as the 50-foot setback. Also, DEP requires new construction in the coastal areas with higher risks of environmental impacts to meet more stringent standards and demonstrate that the proposed project will not result in a significant adverse impact. Additionally, for coastal areas that are further inland, DEP makes 30-year erosion projections and generally will not issue construction permits for areas projected to be within the erosion projection. In lieu of meeting state law restrictions, Florida's local governments may establish coastal construction zoning and building codes as long as they are pre- approved by DEP. In 2020, the State enacted the Clean Waterways Act that strengthens regulatory requirements and provides a wide range of water-quality protection provisions aimed at minimizing the impact of known sources of nutrient pollution, including stormwater-related pollution. The Clean Waterways Act directed DEP and Florida's water management districts to update stormwater design and operation regulations using the latest scientific information.

> *Regulatory Programs and Planning* -- Local Level - DEP also implements programs related to sea-level rise and coastal issues that offer technical assistance and funding to communities dealing with coastal flooding, erosion, and ecosystem changes, including the Beach Management Funding Assistance Program and the Florida Resilient Coastlines Program.

> On the regional level, Broward, Miami-Dade, Monroe, and Palm Beach Counties formed a collaboration, the Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change Compact (Compact), to address climate change. The Compact's work includes developing a Regional Climate Action Plan and developing a Unified Sea-Level Rise Projection. Many local governments in southeast Florida have since incorporated the Compact's projections into their planning documents and policies. Florida's local governments in coastal areas are required to have a coastal management element in their comprehensive plans that uses principles to reduce flood risk and eliminate unsafe development in coastal areas. In certain coastal areas, local governments are authorized to establish an "adaptation action area" designation in their comprehensive plan to develop policies and funding priorities that improve coastal resilience and plan for sea-level rise.

> *Planning for the Future* - Although the State has effectively responded to past environmental events, the State is vulnerable to future environmental events. In order to position itself to effectively respond to future events, the State has taken additional actions to plan for the future. In 2020, the State Legislature enacted legislation, effective July 1, 2021, that requires DEP to adopt rules to develop a standard by which a governmental entity must conduct a sea level impact projection (SLIP) study under certain circumstances prior to commencing construction of a coastal structure. The DEP and the Chief Science Officer will review the SLIP studies in order to develop policies and guidance to address issues that may arise on a statewide basis.
>
> Additionally, in 2021, Governor Ron DeSantis signed into law Senate Bill 1954, which establishes statewide programs for adaptation to flooding and sea level rise. The programs are intended to address flooding all across the state, including the creation of the Resilient Florida Grant Program within the DEP to provide grants to counties or municipalities for community resilience planning, such as vulnerability assessments, plan development, and projects to adapt critical assets. The law also requires DEP to develop a Comprehensive Statewide Flood Vulnerability and Sea Level Rise Data Set and Assessment, including statewide sea level rise projections, containing information necessary to determine the risks of flooding and sea level rise to inland and coastal communities. DEP is also directed to develop the Statewide Flooding and Sea Level Rise Resilience Plan consisting of ranked projects addressing the risks of flooding and sea level rise to communities in the state. Furthermore, the law creates the Florida Flood Hub for Applied Research and Innovation (Hub) within the University of South Florida (USF) College of Marine Science. USF's College of Marine Science will serve as the lead institution to coordinate efforts to support applied research and innovation to address flooding and sea level rise in the state.

Latest OK OS (\$4,120,000, The Oklahoma Development Finance Authority, Oklahoma System of Higher Education, Master Real Property Lease Revenue Bonds, Tax-Exempt Series 2022B, P21626941-P21252966-P21678007.pdf) does not mention tornadoes or climate change as a risk, although it mentions pandemic. Issue size was small, though.

This may reflect the fact that the economic cost of the average hurricane can be 10x the cost of the average tornado. (e.g., this)
