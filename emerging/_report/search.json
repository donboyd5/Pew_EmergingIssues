To what extent might it grow or shrink?\nHow does the risk vary - e.g., across geography, race, age, kind of government? How susceptible are different states and groups?\n\n\n1.1.2 Elements\n\nNatural disasters in general\n\nThe National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI), an agency within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), tracks the cost of environmental disasters, including hurricanes and other tropical cyclones, severe storms, drought, floods, wildfires, crop freezes, and other natural disaster risks.1\nHurricanes vs. tornadoes: according to NOAA (March 2021):\n\nHow does the damage from tornadoes compare to that of hurricanes? The differences are in scale. Even though winds from the strongest tornadoes far exceed that from the strongest hurricanes, hurricanes typically cause much more damage individually and over a season, and over far bigger areas. Economically, tornadoes cause about a tenth as much damage per year, on average, as hurricanes. Hurricanes tend to cause much more overall destruction than tornadoes because of their much larger size, longer duration and their greater variety of ways to affect property. The destructive core in hurricanes can be tens of miles across, last many hours and damage structures through storm surge and rainfall-caused flooding, as well as from wind. Tornadoes, in contrast, tend to be a few hundred yards in diameter, last for minutes and primarily cause damage from their extreme winds.\n\n\n\n1.1.3 Magnitude, likelihood, and variation in the risks\n\n1.1.3.1 Earthquakes\nAlaska is the most earthquake-prone state; it has experienced a magnitude 7.0 earthquake almost every year and a magnitude 8.0 earthquake every 13 years, on average, since 1900. Alaskan earthquakes can trigger damaging tsunamis, which can be particularly threatening for Alaska, Washington, Oregon, California, and Hawaii. California has the greatest earthquake risk, because the state has frequent earthquakes that affect a dense built environment and a large population.2"

    "text": "1.3 Study states\n\nstates and their rationales\n\n\n1.3.1 Florida (hurricanes)\n(Bloetscher, Hoermann, and Berry 2017)\nBloetscher, Hoermann, and Berry (2017) says such and such\n\nIn 2017 Gov. Charlie Crist created the Florida Governor’s Action Team on Energy and Climate Change by executive order. Gov. Rick Scott appears not to have continued (check)\n\nExcerpt from the latest state OS ($132,720,000 State of Florida Full Faith and Credit Department of Transportation Right-of-Way Acquisition and Bridge Construction Refunding Bonds Series 2022A) (EMMA, MSRB-P2414503.zip)\nEnvironmental Risk Factors section:\n\nWith more than 2,000 linear miles of coastline and relatively low elevations, Florida’s weather and natural resources affect its economy in a variety of ways. Economic activity attributable to in-migration and tourism represents a significant part of the State’s economy, and the State’s warm weather and beaches are responsible for attracting seasonal and permanent residents and tourists to the State. In addition, a majority of the State’s residents live and work in coastal counties. Because of the State’s reliance on its natural resources to generate business and sustain in-migration, its economy and financial condition may be vulnerable to the impacts of environmental events, including hurricanes and inland and coastal flooding, as well as long-term environmental risks associated with climate change, such as accelerated sea level rise. \nThe State has effectively responded to past environmental events because of its financial resources, emergency response system, and dedicated leadership and regulatory programs focused on addressing environmental risks. However, the frequency of environmental events, such as hurricanes, may increase on an annual basis according to models and forecasts. Consequently, the magnitude of the impact on the State’s operations, economy, or financial condition from environmental risks is indeterminate and is unpredictable for future environmental events. There can be no assurance that such risks will not have an adverse effect the operations, economy, or financial condition of the State.\nResources - The State has a variety of resources available to respond to damage caused by environmental events. The State has financial reserves available to cover response-related expenditures, and, in most cases, the State can request reimbursement from federal relief funds to pay for a portion of such expenditures. Further, upon a declaration of a state of emergency, Florida law provides the Governor broad spending authority to meet financial needs resulting from a disaster. Notwithstanding multiple hurricanes, State finances and the economy have only experienced temporary economic disruption. In addition, the State has improved its resiliency to the threat of environmental risks through the establishment of the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund and the Citizens Property Insurance Corporation to stabilize the property insurance market in the State.\nEmergency Response - The State can respond to the impacts of environmental events through its robust emergency response system. The Division of Emergency Management (“DEM”) was established as part of the State’s structure to plan for and respond to both natural and manmade disasters. In addition to coordinating disaster response activities, DEM prepares and implements a statewide Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan and routinely conducts extensive exercises to test state and county emergency response capabilities.\nLeadership - The State’s response to environmental risks includes the creation of state-level leadership positions to help coordinate resilience efforts through Florida’s 67 counties and over 400 cities. Although a portion of environmental resiliency efforts in each county or city falls on its respective local government leadership, state-level leadership provides valuable resources and support to the State’s local governments. In 2019, the Governor created the position of Chief Resilience Officer in the Executive Office of the Governor to work with state agencies to, in part, develop and coordinate the implementation of a comprehensive statewide resilience plan with goals designed to adapt to the environmental challenges facing Florida’s communities. Also in 2019, the Governor created the Office of Environmental Accountability and Transparency, led by the State’s Chief Science Officer, to conduct scientific research that focuses on current and emerging environmental concerns most pressing to Floridians. The Chief Resilience Officer consults with the Chief Science Officer on policy issues so that each policy decision takes into consideration the environmental impact strictly from a scientific perspective.\nRegulatory Programs and Planning – State Level - The State’s resilience to environmental risks has been enhanced through state law restrictions and targeted regulatory programs. Coastal construction is regulated by DEP in various ways in order to protect Florida’s beaches and dunes from imprudent construction. For example, under the Coastal Zone Protection Act, Florida law imposes strict construction standards for most activities within the “coastal building zone”, which covers over 1,500 feet from the coastline. Further, the Office of Resilience and Coastal Protection was created within DEP to focus time, energy, and resources into resiliency issues. DEP regulations include a prohibition on most construction within 50 feet of the mean high-water line, known as the 50-foot setback. Also, DEP requires new construction in the coastal areas with higher risks of environmental impacts to meet more stringent standards and demonstrate that the proposed project will not result in a significant adverse impact. Additionally, for coastal areas that are further inland, DEP makes 30-year erosion projections and generally will not issue construction permits for areas projected to be within the erosion projection. In lieu of meeting state law restrictions, Florida’s local governments may establish coastal construction zoning and building codes as long as they are pre- approved by DEP. In 2020, the State enacted the Clean Waterways Act that strengthens regulatory requirements and provides a wide range of water-quality protection provisions aimed at minimizing the impact of known sources of nutrient pollution, including stormwater-related pollution. The Clean Waterways Act directed DEP and Florida’s water management districts to update stormwater design and operation regulations using the latest scientific information.\nRegulatory Programs and Planning – Local Level - DEP also implements programs related to sea-level rise and coastal issues that offer technical assistance and funding to communities dealing with coastal flooding, erosion, and ecosystem changes, including the Beach Management Funding Assistance Program and the Florida Resilient Coastlines Program.\nOn the regional level, Broward, Miami-Dade, Monroe, and Palm Beach Counties formed a collaboration, the Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change Compact (Compact), to address climate change. The Compact’s work includes developing a Regional Climate Action Plan and developing a Unified Sea-Level Rise Projection. Many local governments in southeast Florida have since incorporated the Compact’s projections into their planning documents and policies. Florida’s local governments in coastal areas are required to have a coastal management element in their comprehensive plans that uses principles to reduce flood risk and eliminate unsafe development in coastal areas. In certain coastal areas, local governments are authorized to establish an “adaptation action area” designation in their comprehensive plan to develop policies and funding priorities that improve coastal resilience and plan for sea-level rise.\nPlanning for the Future - Although the State has effectively responded to past environmental events, the State is vulnerable to future environmental events. In order to position itself to effectively respond to future events, the State has taken additional actions to plan for the future. In 2020, the State Legislature enacted legislation, effective July 1, 2021, that requires DEP to adopt rules to develop a standard by which a governmental entity must conduct a sea level impact projection (SLIP) study under certain circumstances prior to commencing construction of a coastal structure. The DEP and the Chief Science Officer will review the SLIP studies in order to develop policies and guidance to address issues that may arise on a statewide basis.\nAdditionally, in 2021, Governor Ron DeSantis signed into law Senate Bill 1954, which establishes statewide programs for adaptation to flooding and sea level rise. The programs are intended to address flooding all across the state, including the creation of the Resilient Florida Grant Program within the DEP to provide grants to counties or municipalities for community resilience planning, such as vulnerability assessments, plan development, and projects to adapt critical assets. The law also requires DEP to develop a Comprehensive Statewide Flood Vulnerability and Sea Level Rise Data Set and Assessment, including statewide sea level rise projections, containing information necessary to determine the risks of flooding and sea level rise to inland and coastal communities. DEP is also directed to develop the Statewide Flooding and Sea Level Rise Resilience Plan consisting of ranked projects addressing the risks of flooding and sea level rise to communities in the state. Furthermore, the law creates the Florida Flood Hub for Applied Research and Innovation (Hub) within the University of South Florida (USF) College of Marine Science. USF’s College of Marine Science will serve as the lead institution to coordinate efforts to support applied research and innovation to address flooding and sea level rise in the state.\n\n\n\n1.3.2 Oklahoma (tornadoes)\nLatest OK OS ($4,120,000, The Oklahoma Development Finance Authority, Oklahoma System of Higher Education, Master Real Property Lease Revenue Bonds, Tax-Exempt Series 2022B, P21626941-P21252966-P21678007.pdf) does not mention tornadoes or climate change as a risk, although it mentions pandemic. Issue size was small, though.\nThis may reflect the fact that the economic cost of the average hurricane can be 10x the cost of the average tornado.
